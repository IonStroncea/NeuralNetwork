This is a test application to get used to neural networks on a very low level. 
Basically all logic of neural network is written by hand without any other libraries.

Project code is without neural networks due to their excessive size.

The application contains 2 neural networks:
1. recognize the crisis numbers of the mine
2. detect girls on images.

The result of the application can be seen in the images.
